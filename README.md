# Information Retrival Model

One of the most important aspect of search engine is returning relevant results out of the entire document set. Furthermore, the engine should be optimized to select the most relevant documents. Most of our effort in this project is in the direction of improving the recall and the average precision values. Designing an optimum weighted query, and tuning the respective model to improve precision is the challenge. In this document we try to optimize these values using custom designed scripts and propose an algorithm to assign weights according to the provided relevancy. We discuss in detail about the implementation and the outcome of our implementation in the report document.
